        Article 1: Why are bugs important?
        </h2>
        <p>
       Bugs help us in many ways. Mantids eat those pesky flies that land on your food. There would be much less fruit in the world without bees and butterflies polinating. Bugs do things that greatly help us. Without bugs, we would not have that many reptiles, and the things that eat them. Without bugs, even we might not be here

        Article 2: Save a bug!
        </h2>
        <p>It is important to save bugs. Think of the Xerxes, the brilliant bluish-purple butterfly that went extinct. Can we bring it back? no. Then why are we killing them in the firt place? If we can't fix it, then why do we break it? When will we start fixing, not even dropping the plate in the fist place, instead? Start saving bugs. You can save them by:</p>
        <li>
        Planting flowers/making a garden.
        </li>
        <li>
        Buy organic foods.
        </li>
        <li>
        Try to raise bugs and possibly try to breed them!
        </li>
