        Article 1: Why are bugs important?
        </h2>
        <p>
       Bugs help us in many ways. Mantids eat those pesky flies that land on your food. There would be much less fruit in the world without bees and butterflies pollinating. Bugs do things that greatly help us. Without bugs, we would not have that many reptiles, and the things that eat them. Without bugs, even we might not be here

If we can't fix it, then why do we break it? Start saving bugs. You can save them by following the tips below.</p>
